# pandas-challenge
Pandas application to school district metrics.  Folowing jupyter notebook analyses the district-wide standardized test results based on every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The data is aggregated to showcase obvious trends in school performance.



**Final considerations and trend observation**
* Small and medium schools with number of studens `<2000` are performing better than large schools 
* Spending per student actually is smaller for better performing schools if on judges by math and reading scores.
* Charter schools perform better than the district schools.
* Math and reading scores do not vay by grade but rather by school.
